Recall from the previous video the concept of the coefficient of determination,
also known as the R2 value. This is computed by 1 - (variability of errors)**2/
(variability of data)**2. The variability of the errors is computed by taking
the sum of the (observed - predicted) errors. We normalize this variablity by
dividing it by the variability of the data, which is sum of (observation -
avarage_observation) for each observation.

In the file L17_code.py, this R2 value is computed by the function rSquare.

1. In L17_code.py, revise fitData and fitData3 to report the coefficient of
   determination for the fitted line in each case. Did this measure of the
   "goodness of fit" improve when we eliminated the measurements after the
   spring reached its elastic limit and Hooke's Law no longer applied?
    Answer: Yes
