To model data effectively, it is important to understand the underlying model
that describes the data. This means that knowing the physical phenomenon or
event that is being modeled is extremely important. For each of the following
data/phenomena/events, describe what type of model (linear, quadratic, other)
you would use to describe the underlying phenomena.

1. Hourly temperature from 7am to 7pm
    Answer: quadratic

2. Gravitational force on an object as mass increases
    Answer: linear

3. Displacement of a mass on a hanging spring from the ceiling
    Answer: other

4. It is also important to understand physical phenomena and their limitations
   when modeling data. Which of the following are true?
    Answer: Even though hourly temperature fluctuations throughout the day may
            oscillate for a variety of reasons (wind, cloud cover, etc), the
            underlying trend is quadratic and using a quadratic model is most
            appropriate.

            At some point, some physical phenomena have limitations that do not
            fit their mathematical models (i.e. springs have an elastic limit).

5. When modeling, the model that has the biggest R^2 value is always the best
   model.
    Answer: False
