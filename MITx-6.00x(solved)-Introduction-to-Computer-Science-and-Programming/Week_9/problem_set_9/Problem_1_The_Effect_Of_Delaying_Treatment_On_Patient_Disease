1. If you consider final virus particle counts of 0-50 to be cured (or in
   remission), approximately what percentage of patients were cured (or in
   remission) at the end of the simulation?

   1. delay = 300
      Answer: 0 - 5%

   2. delay = 150
      Answer: 0 - 5%

   3. delay = 75
      Answer: 6 - 15%

   4. delay = 0
      Answer: 86 - 100%

2. What type of distribution does the histogram for delay = 0 create?
  Answer: None of the above

3. What is the relationship between when drugs are applied and patients being
   cured?
    Answer: Applying the drug earlier means the patient is more likely to be
            cured.

4. For the following, assume the delay is 150. Answer these questions on
   changing the initial parameters of a simulation.

   1. Increasing the length of the viruses list decreases the number of patients
      cured.
        Answer: TRUE

   2. Increasing the maxPop decreases the number of patients cured.
        Answer: TRUE

   3. Increasing the maxBirthProb decreases the number of patients cured.
        Answer: TRUE

   4. Increasing the clearProb decreases the number of patients cured.
        Answer: FALSE

   5. Initializing each virus with resistance to guttagonol means no viruses
      will be killed.
        Answer: FALSE
