1. If you consider final virus particle counts of 0-50 to be cured (or in
   remission), approximately what percentage of patients were cured (or in
   remission) at the end of the simulation?

   1. delay of 2nd drug = 300
      Answer: 0 - 15%

   2. delay of 2nd drug = 150
      Answer: 0 - 30%

   3. delay of 2nd drug = 75
      Answer: 31 - 65%

   4. delay of 2nd drug = 0
      Answer: 66 - 100%

2. What is the relationship between when drugs are applied and patients being
   cured?
    Answer: Applying the 2nd drug earlier means the patient is more likely to be
            cured.

3. Increasing mutProb will increase the number of cured patients.
    Answer: False

4. The relationship between number of cured patients and when the delay occurs
   linear.
    Answer: False

5. Of the four delay values tested, which has the lowest variance?
    Answer: delay of 2nd drug = 0
