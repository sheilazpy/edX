Consider our continuing problem of permutations of three students in a line.
Use the enumeration we established when adding the nodes to our graph. That is,

----------------------------------------
| nodes = []                           |
| nodes.append(Node("ABC")) # nodes[0] |
| nodes.append(Node("ACB")) # nodes[1] |
| nodes.append(Node("BAC")) # nodes[2] |
| nodes.append(Node("BCA")) # nodes[3] |
| nodes.append(Node("CAB")) # nodes[4] |
| nodes.append(Node("CBA")) # nodes[5] |
----------------------------------------
so that ABC is Node 0, BCA is Node 3, etc.

Using Depth First Search, and beginning at the listed source nodes, give the
first path found to the listed destination nodes. For the purpose of this
exercise, assume DFS prioritizes lower numbered nodes. For example, if Node 2 is
connected to Nodes 3 and 4, the first path checked will be 23. Additionally, DFS
will never return to a node already in its path.

To denote a path, simply list the numbers of the nodes exactly as done in the
lecture.

Hint: It might be useful to draw yourself a visual representation of this graph.

We saw before that for permutations of 3 people in line, any two nodes are at
most three edges, or four nodes, away. But DFS has yielded paths longer than
three edges! In this graph, given a random source and a random destination, what
is the probability of DFS finding a path of the shortest possible length?
  Answer: 2/3
