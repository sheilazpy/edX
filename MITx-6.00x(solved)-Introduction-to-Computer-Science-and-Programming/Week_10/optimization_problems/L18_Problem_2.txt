As a burgler robs a house, she finds the following items:

Dirt - Weight: 4, Value: 0
Computer - Weight: 10, Value: 30
Fork - Weight: 5, Value: 1
Problem Set - Weight: 0, Value: -10
This time, she can only carry a weight of 14, and wishes to maximize the value
to weight ratio of the things she carries. She employs three different metrics
in an attempt to do this, and writes an algorithm in Python to determine which
loot to take.

The algorithm works as follows:

Evaluate the metric of each item. Each metric returns a numerical value for each
item. For each item, from highest metric value to lowest, add the item if there
is room in the bag. Describe the heuristic that each of the following 3 metrics
uses, and choose the result of running the algorithm with each metric.

1. Metric 1:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | def metric1(item):                                                          |
 |    return item.getValue() / float(item.getWeight()) # We want exact values! |
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Which heuristic does Metric 1 employ?
    Answer: Choose the item with the best value to weight ratio first.

  2. What will be the result of running the burgler's algorithm with Metric 1?
    Answer: The algorithm does not run.

2. Metric 2:
   -------------------------------
  | def metric2(item):            |
  |     return - item.getWeight() |
   -------------------------------

   1. Which heuristic does Metric 2 employ?
    Answer: Choose the lightest object first.

   2. What will be the result of running the burgler's algorithm with Metric 2?
    Answer: The algorithm runs and returns a non-optimal solution.

3. Metric 3:
   ----------------------------
  | def metric3(item):         |
  |     return item.getValue() |
   ----------------------------

   1. Which heuristic does Metric 3 employ?
    Answer: Choose the most valuable object first.

   2. What will be the result of running the burgler's algorithm with Metric 3?
    Answer: The algorithm runs and returns a non-optimal solution.
