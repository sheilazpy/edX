edX-CS50x-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-I
============================================

CS50x is Harvard College's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. As of Fall 2012, the on-campus version of CS50x is Harvard's second-largest course.

Students who earn a passing grade on 8 problem sets (programming assignments - 15-20 hours each), 2 quizzes, and a final project will get a certificate from HarvardX. Students may take CS50x at their own pace.
