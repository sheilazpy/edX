Experiment with the function testErrors() from the lecture code file. Try using
a different probability distribution to model the errors, say random.uniform
(you'll need to look at the documentaion for the random module to determine the
correct arguments).

1. Do you get the same result as claimed in the lecture? Does the probability
   distribution for the sums approach a normal distribution?
    Answer: Yes

2. Try increasing the number of trials. Does the result look more like the
   normal distribution?
    Answer: Yes

3. What happens to the variance of the normal distribution as you increase the
   number of trials?
    Answer: The variance decreases
