1. For questions 1 and 2, consider our previous problem (permutations of 3
   students in a line).

   When represented as a tree, each node will have how many children?
    Answer: 2

2. Given two permutations, what is the maximum number of swaps it will take
   to reach one from the other?
    Answer: 3

3. For questions 3 and 4, consider the general case of our previous problem
   (permutations of n students in a line). Give your answer in terms of n.

   When represented as a tree, each node will have how many children?
    Answer: n - 1

4. Given two permutations, what is the maximum number of swaps it will take to
   reach one from the other?
    Answer: n * (n - 1)/2
