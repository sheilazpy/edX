We often use graphs to simplify optimization problems, as they are easy
implement on a computer.

The following concepts can be illustrated with a graph. Determine which
variables should be represented by edges and vertices in this graph.

1. A school's course catalog

  Some classes must occur at least one semester before certain other classes
  (e.g., Calculus I must be taken before Calculus II), but not all classes have
  prerequisites.

  If we want to represent the catalog as a graph, which variables should be
  represented as edges and vertices?

    Answer: B) Each vertex is a class, while a directional edge indicates that
            one class must come before another.

2. Students in a line

  Second graders are lining up to go to their next class, but must be ordered
  alphabetically before they can leave. The teacher only swaps the positions of
  two students that are next to each other in line.

  If we want to represent this situation as a graph, which variables should be
  represented as edges and vertices?

    Answer: A) Vertices represent permutations of the students in line. Edges
            connect two permutations if one can be made into the other by
            swapping two adjacent students.
