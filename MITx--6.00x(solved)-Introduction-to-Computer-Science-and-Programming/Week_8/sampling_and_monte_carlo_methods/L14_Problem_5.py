1. If our hash table has 1000 buckets and we perform 50 insertions, what is the calculated probability of a collision? Answer to at least 3 decimal places.
    Answer: .712

2. If our hash table has 1000 buckets and we perform 200 insertions, what is the calculated probability of a collision? Answer to at least 3 decimal places.
    Answer: .999

3. If our hash table has 1000 buckets and we perform 50 insertions, perform a simulation to observe the probability of a collision. Run for at least 1000 trials; answer to at least 3 decimal places.
    Answer: .7

4. If our hash table has 1000 buckets and we perform 200 insertions, perform a simulation to observe the probability of a collision. Run for at least 1000 trials; answer to at least 3 decimal places.
    Answer: 1.0

5. Say you're in a classroom with 29 other students (30 total students). What is the calculated probability that two students share the same birthdate? For simplicity, assume there are 365 days in a year and all birthdates are equally probable. Answer to at least 3 decimal places.
    Answer: .706

6. Say you're in a lecture hall with 249 other students (250 total students). What is the calculated probability that two students share the same birthdate? For simplicity, assume there are 365 days in a year and all birthdates are equally probable. Answer to at least 3 decimal places.
    Answer: 1.0

7. What's the largest classroom size where the probability of two students sharing the same birthday is less than 0.99? Hint: either write a function that loops through values and finds this for you, or perform a manual bisection search.
    Answer: 56
